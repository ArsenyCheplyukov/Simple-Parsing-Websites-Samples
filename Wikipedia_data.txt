Macrolepiota albuminosa


Macrolepiota albuminosa is a species of agaric fungus in the family Agaricaceae, found in Peradeniya, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).

In 1847, English mycologist Miles Joseph Berkeley scientifically described it and named it Agaricus albuminosus. It was transferred to the genus Termitomyces in 1941 by the French botanist Roger Heim. In 1972, British mycologist David Pegler reexamined the specimen, and moved it to Macrolepiota.[3]

Frequently, the name Collybia albuminosa is misused for Termitomyces eurrhizus,[4] and the name Termitomyces albuminosus for Termitomyces mushrooms.[5][6]
